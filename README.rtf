This project is part of the exam course "Vision and Perception" of the master in "Artificial Intelligence and Robotics" at "La Sapienza Universit√† di Roma"

The paper and the code from which I started this project are available here: https://paperswithcode.com/paper/mantra-net-manipulation-tracing-network-for

This repository contains:

-ManTraNetProgect.jpynb is the file containing the code of the project

-GenerateDataset.jpynb contain the code for generation of a dataset for image manipulation classification task

-Mantranet training is a folder containing sub-folders, each one contains the plotted graphics of some training tries of the model

- Dataset used are:
  -CASIA
  -Columbia images for splicing detection
  -A small dataset found online with forged images and corresponded mask
  -Alaska2 image Steganalysis
